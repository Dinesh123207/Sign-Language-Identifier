In this code, several data structures are used:

Lists: Lists are used to store error values (error = []), to extract coordinates from hand landmarks (coords = []), and to store predicted class labels (predicted = []).

Numpy Arrays: Numpy arrays are used to represent the feature variables (X), target variable (Y), and the scaled feature variables (X_train and X_test). These arrays are more efficient for numerical operations compared to Python lists.

Pandas DataFrame: Pandas DataFrame (dataset) is used to store and manipulate the dataset retrieved from the CSV file.

Classes and Objects: Several classes and objects are instantiated and utilized, such as the KNeighborsClassifier class (classifier) from scikit-learn, StandardScaler (scaler), and Hands and DrawingUtils from Mediapipe (mp_hands, mp_drawing).

Dictionaries: Although not explicitly seen in this code snippet, dictionaries are commonly used in machine learning pipelines for hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and more.
